# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## 1. What is Liskov Substitution Principle?
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states:

**"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."**

This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without breaking the functionality of the application. It emphasizes maintaining the behavior expected by the superclass in the derived classes.

---

## 2. Where to Use Liskov Substitution Principle?
You should use the Liskov Substitution Principle in the following scenarios:

- When designing object-oriented systems to ensure robust and reusable code.
- In inheritance hierarchies where subclasses extend base classes.
- When working with polymorphism to maintain the integrity of behavior across derived classes.
- In systems requiring flexibility and scalability while ensuring functionality remains intact.

---

## 3. Why Use Liskov Substitution Principle?
The primary reasons for using LSP are:

- **Code Reusability:** Ensures that subclasses can seamlessly replace their parent classes without introducing errors.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies understanding, updating, and debugging of the codebase.
- **Flexibility:** Encourages adherence to expected behaviors, making the system easier to extend.
- **Reliability:** Prevents unexpected behavior when using polymorphism.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates the addition of new subclasses without affecting existing functionality.

---

## 4. Pros and Cons of Liskov Substitution Principle
### Pros:
- **Encourages Robust Design:** Forces developers to maintain consistent behavior between base and derived classes.
- **Improves Code Quality:** Enhances code reliability and clarity.
- **Facilitates Extensibility:** Allows new subclasses to be introduced without modifying existing code.
- **Reduces Testing Overhead:** Ensures that derived classes don‚Äôt need separate tests for inherited behavior.

### Cons:
- **Requires Strict Adherence:** Developers need to rigorously follow this principle, which may introduce complexity in design.
- **Potential Overhead:** Adapting code to comply with LSP might require additional time and effort during development.

---

## 5. Analogy of Liskov Substitution Principle
Imagine a power outlet and a set of appliances:

- A power outlet provides electricity (the base class behavior).
- Appliances like a fan, a lamp, and a phone charger (subclasses) must all work with the power outlet without requiring modifications to the outlet.

If a phone charger required a different kind of outlet, it would violate the principle. LSP ensures that all appliances behave consistently with the outlet‚Äôs expectations.

---

## 6. Real-World Use Case of Liskov Substitution Principle
### Use Case: Payment Systems
In a payment processing application, there could be a base class `PaymentProcessor` that defines a method `processPayment()`. Derived classes like `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, and `UPIProcessor` should adhere to the behavior defined in `PaymentProcessor`.

If a `PayPalProcessor` deviates from the expected behavior and, for example, adds a non-standard verification step, it could break the system.

---

## 7. Code Example of a Real-World Use Case Using C++
Here‚Äôs a C++ example of adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class PaymentProcessor {
public:
    virtual void processPayment(double amount) const {
        cout << "Processing payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
    virtual ~PaymentProcessor() {}
};

// Derived class 1
class CreditCardProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing credit card payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 2
class PayPalProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing PayPal payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 3
class UPIProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing UPI payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Client Code
void makePayment(const PaymentProcessor& processor, double amount) {
    processor.processPayment(amount);
}

int main() {
    CreditCardProcessor creditCard;
    PayPalProcessor payPal;
    UPIProcessor upi;

    vector<PaymentProcessor*> processors = {&creditCard, &payPal, &upi};

    for (const auto& processor : processors) {
        makePayment(*processor, 100.0);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Class:** `PaymentProcessor` defines a common interface for payment processing.
2. **Derived Classes:** Each subclass (e.g., `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, `UPIProcessor`) adheres to the base class‚Äôs behavior while adding specific functionality.
3. **Client Code:** The `makePayment` function works seamlessly with any `PaymentProcessor`, ensuring compliance with LSP.

# **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in Java**

## **1. Definition of LSP**

The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** states that:

> ‚ÄúObjects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.‚Äù
> 

This means:

- A **subclass should extend** the behavior of a superclass **without altering its fundamental functionality**.
- A **subclass should not break the expectations** set by its parent class.

‚úÖ **Key Idea:** **A subclass should be a proper substitute for its superclass.**

---

## **2. Why is LSP Crucial in OOP?**

LSP ensures:

1. **Code remains flexible and reusable** ‚Äì You can substitute subclasses without breaking existing behavior.
2. **Avoids unexpected bugs** ‚Äì Incorrect subclassing leads to runtime failures.
3. **Supports polymorphism effectively** ‚Äì A superclass reference should be able to hold any of its subclasses **without breaking functionality**.
4. **Encourages proper inheritance hierarchies** ‚Äì Avoids **incorrect IS-A relationships**.

üö® **Without LSP, using polymorphism can lead to incorrect behavior.**

---

## **3. Violating LSP with Real-World Examples**

Consider a **Bird class** where we assume all birds can fly.

### ‚ùå **Bad Example: Violating LSP**

```java
java
CopyEdit
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying...");
    }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird {
    // Can fly, so this works fine.
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    // Penguins cannot fly, but they still inherit the fly() method.
}

```

üî¥ **Why is this bad?**

- `Penguin` **inherits** from `Bird`, but it **cannot fly**.
- If we use polymorphism (`Bird bird = new Penguin();`), calling `bird.fly();` **violates expectations**.

üö® **LSP Violation:**

- **Penguin IS-A Bird**, but **it does not behave like one** in terms of flying.

---

## **4. Understanding IS-A vs. BEHAVES-LIKE-A**

- **IS-A relationship (Inheritance)** should mean **full substitutability**.
- If a subclass **does not fully behave like its parent**, it **violates LSP**.

‚úÖ **Better Approach: Define Bird behaviors correctly**

```java
java
CopyEdit
abstract class Bird {
    abstract void eat();
}

abstract class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    abstract void fly();
}

class Sparrow extends FlyingBird {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Sparrow eating..."); }
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Sparrow flying..."); }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Penguin eating..."); }
}

```

‚úÖ **Now, non-flying birds like Penguins don‚Äôt inherit an unwanted `fly()` method.**

‚úÖ **This adheres to LSP, ensuring correct behavior.**

---

## **5. Guidelines for Creating Proper Inheritance Hierarchies**

To follow LSP:

1. **Subclasses should not remove expected behavior.**
2. **Avoid overriding methods that fundamentally change the superclass behavior.**
3. **Use interfaces or abstract classes to separate behaviors.**
4. **Prefer Composition over Inheritance** when behavior varies significantly.

---

## **6. Code Examples**

### ‚ùå **Bad Example: Violating LSP**

Let's say we have a `Rectangle` class.

```java
java
CopyEdit
class Rectangle {
    protected int width, height;

    public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; }
    public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; }
    public int getArea() { return width * height; }
}

```

We now create a **Square** class that extends `Rectangle`:

```java
java
CopyEdit
class Square extends Rectangle {
    @Override
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = width; // Always enforce height = width
    }

    @Override
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.width = height;
        this.height = height; // Always enforce width = height
    }
}

```

üö® **LSP Violation:**

- `Square` **modifies** how `setWidth()` and `setHeight()` work.
- If a function expects a `Rectangle`, passing a `Square` **breaks expected behavior**.

**Example of Broken Behavior:**

```java
java
CopyEdit
public static void resizeRectangle(Rectangle rect) {
    rect.setWidth(5);
    rect.setHeight(10);
    System.out.println("Expected Area: 50, Actual Area: " + rect.getArea());
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
    resizeRectangle(rectangle); // Works fine

    Rectangle square = new Square();
    resizeRectangle(square); // Unexpected result due to LSP violation
}

```

üî¥ **Problem:** We expect `getArea()` to return `5 * 10 = 50`, but for a `Square`, it will always have equal width and height.

---

## **7. Applying LSP Correctly**

‚úÖ **Solution: Use separate classes without forcing inheritance**

```java
java
CopyEdit
interface Shape {
    int getArea();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    protected int width, height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getArea() { return width * height; }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    private int side;

    public Square(int side) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    public int getArea() { return side * side; }
}

```

‚úÖ **Now, `Square` and `Rectangle` are separate, avoiding LSP violations.**

‚úÖ **Each class behaves exactly as expected.**

---

## **8. Using Composition Over Inheritance for Better LSP Adherence**

Instead of forcing **inheritance**, use **composition** when objects have different behaviors.

### **Example: Using Composition**

```java
java
CopyEdit
interface Bird {
    void eat();
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Sparrow implements Bird, Flyable {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Sparrow eating..."); }
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Sparrow flying..."); }
}

class Penguin implements Bird {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Penguin eating..."); }
}

```

‚úÖ **Now, only birds that can fly implement `Flyable`, avoiding unnecessary methods.**

‚úÖ **Penguin and Sparrow are independent and behave as expected.**

---

## **9. Design Patterns Related to LSP**

### **1. Adapter Pattern**

- Used when two incompatible interfaces need to work together.
- Ensures that a class can substitute another without modifying existing code.

‚úÖ **Example:**

```java
java
CopyEdit
interface MediaPlayer {
    void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}

class MP3Player implements MediaPlayer {
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing MP3 file: " + fileName);
    }
}

```

Now, suppose we need to support MP4 files. Instead of modifying `MP3Player`, we use an **adapter**:

```java
java
CopyEdit
class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private AdvancedMediaPlayer advancedMusicPlayer;

    public MediaAdapter(String audioType) {
        if(audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            advancedMusicPlayer = new MP4Player();
        }
    }

    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if(audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            advancedMusicPlayer.playMP4(fileName);
        }
    }
}

```

‚úÖ **Ensures `MediaPlayer` remains substitutable while adding new behavior.**

---

### **2. Composite Pattern**

- Used when objects need to be treated **uniformly**, whether they are individual or part of a group.

‚úÖ **Example:**

```java
java
CopyEdit
interface Employee {
    void showDetails();
}

class Developer implements Employee {
    private String name;

    public Developer(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public void showDetails() { System.out.println("Developer: " + name); }
}

class Manager implements Employee {
    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addEmployee(Employee emp) { employees.add(emp); }
    public void showDetails() {
        for (Employee e : employees) e.showDetails();
    }
}

```

‚úÖ **Ensures correct substitution and hierarchy management.**

---

## **10. Conclusion**

‚úÖ **LSP ensures proper inheritance and correct behavior substitution.**

‚úÖ **Use interfaces, composition, and correct hierarchy design.**

‚úÖ **Patterns like Adapter & Composite help enforce LSP.**
