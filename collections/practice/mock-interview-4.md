## **Java Collections – Mock Interview: Round 4**

### **Interviewer:** Time for advanced design patterns, scalability, and tricky corner cases with Java Collections.

---

### **Q1. [Data Expiry System]**

**Scenario**: You're building a **cache** where each entry expires after 10 minutes.

**Question**:

How would you design this system using Java Collections? What data structures will help you track expiry times efficiently?

---

### **Q2. [Tag-Based Filtering System]**

**Scenario**: You have a blog platform where articles can have multiple tags. You need to implement a feature to **get all articles matching a set of tags**.

**Question**:

Which collections would you use to store this data? How would you implement efficient tag-based filtering?

---

### **Q3. [Duplicate File Finder]**

**Scenario**: You're scanning files in a directory and want to group together all files that have the same size and content hash.

**Question**:

Which Java Collections would you use to implement this grouping?

---

### **Q4. [Social Network Friends Graph]**

**Scenario**: You’re building a social network and want to model users and their mutual friendships.

**Question**:

How would you represent this using Java Collections? What would be the optimal data structure to find mutual friends?

---

### **Q5. [Auto-Complete System]**

**Scenario**: You need to implement an auto-complete system that returns suggestions based on a given prefix.

**Question**:

How would you build and query this efficiently using Java Collections if you’re not allowed to use a Trie?

---

### **Q6. [Order-Preserving Cache]**

**Scenario**: You want to build a cache that stores up to 1000 items and maintains **insertion order**.

**Question**:

Which Java Collection would you use, and how would you remove the oldest item once the size exceeds the limit?

---

### **Q7. [Batch Processing Queue]**

**Scenario**: You're collecting events and once 100 are gathered, you need to process them in order.

**Question**:

Which Java Collection is ideal for this kind of batching and what would your logic look like?

---

### **Q8. [Custom Set Behavior]**

**Scenario**: You need a set where equality is determined only by a subset of object fields (e.g., only by `email`, ignoring name and age).

**Question**:

How would you implement this in Java? What should be overridden in your class to work correctly with `HashSet`?

---

### **Q9. [Most Recently Accessed Tracking]**

**Scenario**: You’re building an analytics dashboard and want to track the **most recently accessed pages** by a user.

**Question**:

What collection(s) would you use to track this order and ensure no duplicates?

---

### **Q10. [Dependency Resolution]**

**Scenario**: You’re building a **package manager** where some packages depend on others. Before installing a package, all dependencies must be installed.

**Question**:

How would you model this using Java Collections? What traversal algorithm would you use?
