Here are **scenario-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** interview questions designed to test your understanding of OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction), design decisions, and real-world applications. These are especially helpful for Java Developer interviews.

---

### **1. Encapsulation**

**Scenario:**

You're working on a banking application. The `BankAccount` class has fields like `balance`, `accountNumber`, and `accountHolderName`.

**Question:**

How would you ensure that `balance` cannot be modified directly from outside the class, but can only be updated through deposit and withdrawal methods?

---

### **2. Inheritance**

**Scenario:**

You’re building a school management system. You have classes like `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher`.

**Question:**

How would you design the class hierarchy using inheritance? What properties and behaviors would you put in the parent class vs. child classes?

---

### **3. Polymorphism**

**Scenario:**

In an e-commerce system, you have different payment methods: `CreditCard`, `UPI`, `PayPal`.

**Question:**

How would you use polymorphism to handle different payment methods in a unified way? How would you call the `processPayment()` method regardless of the payment type?

---

### **4. Abstraction**

**Scenario:**

You are designing a system for a vehicle rental company. Vehicles can be cars, bikes, or trucks.

**Question:**

How would you use abstraction to represent common behaviors of vehicles while hiding implementation details?

---

### **5. Interface vs Abstract Class**

**Scenario:**

You’re building a plugin system where plugins can be developed by third parties.

**Question:**

Would you use an interface or an abstract class for the plugin contract? Why?

---

### **6. Real-World Modeling**

**Scenario:**

Design a class structure for a library system where books can be borrowed by members. A book can be reserved, issued, or returned.

**Question:**

How would you model this using OOP? Which classes would you create and how would they interact?

---

### **7. Composition vs Inheritance**

**Scenario:**

You have a `Car` class that has an `Engine`. You’re debating between inheritance and composition.

**Question:**

Would you inherit `Engine` in `Car`, or would you include it as a field? Why?

---

### **8. SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility)**

**Scenario:**

In a report generation class, you handle fetching data, formatting it, and printing it.

**Question:**

Which OOP principle is violated here and how would you refactor it?

---

Would you use method overloading or overriding? Explain with examples.

---

### **10. Open/Closed Principle**

**Scenario:**

You're adding a new shape (`Triangle`) to an existing shape area calculator, which already supports `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

**Question:**

**Scenario:**

You have a `NotificationService` that sends emails. Later, you need to support SMS and push notifications.

**Question:**

How would you design your classes to support multiple notification types without modifying `NotificationService` every time?

---

### **12. Object Lifecycle**

**Scenario:**

In a Java-based shopping app, `Cart` objects are created for every user session.

### **13. Interface Segregation**

**Scenario:**

You have a `Printer` interface with methods `print()`, `scan()`, and `fax()`. But some printers only print.

**Question:**

What design improvement would you make here to follow interface segregation principle?

---

### **14. Aggregation vs Composition**

**Question:**

How would you model this relationship: aggregation or composition? Why?

---
